if node routes through n1 to get to n2
    then node will send U message to n1 with distance from node to n2 set to INF


if node.forwardTable[n2] == n1:
    poisonVector.costToDict[n2] = INF

I am node x
received Dv from neighbor v
for every node y in network:
    Dx(y) = minimum of {c(x,v) + Dv(y)}

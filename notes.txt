coding routing algorithms

Python would be the easiest language to use (perhaps GO?)

Get updated zip file of the assignment

create bash script for starting/stopping routers

periodic updates (learn something about select)

for connected datagram sockets: syscalls are socket, bind, AND connect
sense you're connected, can only talk with that router, so in the future you know where msgs are coming from

my code shouldn't use the link files, but looking at them lets you see the graph of routers

A.cfg:
	B 7 1 1

	7 link cost from A to B
	2nd number offset(+) from local(A) baseport
	3rd number offset(+) from remote(B) baseport

routers:
	has the baseport number
	used for unconnected UDP

Look at "The Pocket Guide" book

man select  (timeout is counter intuitive)

might be good to generate own test based on examples with known solutions
(no routers with more then 10 links or will need to change baseports to avoid collisions)

Implementing the select loop that determines which socket to read: (call function FOO)

Implementing the routing table/distance vector update algorithm (I strongly urge that the code for this NOT be embedded in the select loop, but rather in a separate function that the select loop code can call. (create function FOO)

----------------------------------

tmux for splitting terminal

tail -f  (keep looking at the end of a file)

program arg1 | ts >> output

ts (adds timestamp)

program arg1 | ts | tee output

tee (stdout and to file)
